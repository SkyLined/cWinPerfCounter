# This file lists common processor architectures and versions of node that
# the "build.cmd" script should create ".node" files for in the "addon" folder.
# This normally includes all the highest node versions that did not introduce
# breaking changes to the addon structure. Each of these builds should work in
# previous compatible version, reducing the total number of builds required
# to support a wide range of node versions.
